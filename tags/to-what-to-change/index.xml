The Process would be divided into stages; the work would enter a certain stage, change state and continue, having as client the next stage. The final step would be for the user, buyer of the product or service. At each stage there would be production, that is, something would happen in the assets that enter the stage, causing its exit in a different state.</description></item><item><title>The Financial Indicators</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/indicators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/indicators/</guid><description>Inspired on Goldratt&amp;rsquo;s indicators for the Theory of Constraints, the Financial Indicators are listed below. The simplicity of the equations is vital to their general acceptance and understanding. This is the basic financial information that companies of any type and size should maintain.

TPM consolidates failures and waste into a creative approach, using time as a common link.
Thus, Working Time is defined as the total journey time that company works. From then on, we will be discounting the time spent on failures and waste, creating indexes that will selectively signal machine and equipment performance problems, operation failures and product defects.</description></item><item><title>P&amp;Q Factory</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/pq-factory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/pq-factory/</guid><description>This is the Process used as a sample when a process is needed in this project.
The P&amp;amp;Q Factory gives no room for apology and demonstrates how the &amp;ldquo;Theory of Constraints&amp;rdquo; can help managers with their decision-making logic. The fictional factory portfolio has products P &amp;amp; Q.
P&amp;amp;Q Factory Using TPM to describe the P&amp;amp;Q Factory, there is little reason to blame poor corporate results:
ati = 1 Equipment runs nonstop for the working time, available time index is 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
