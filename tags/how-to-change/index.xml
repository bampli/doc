Check the Net Profit and Gain formulas below:
\( \begin{aligned} NP&amp;=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\ G&amp;=PS-RM \\ \end{aligned} \) NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead
Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses.</description></item><item><title>Company &amp; Planet</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/company-planet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/company-planet/</guid><description>The Company and the Planet The following relationships rule the interaction between the Company and the Planet. COMPANY The Company has a Investor that own Shares that decide how to manage a Facility that implements a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more. PLANET The Planet has a Product made by a Process expressed by a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more.</description></item><item><title>The Stage</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/stage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/stage/</guid><description>In order to analyze thoroughly the Stage of the Process, we should consider the production flows that results in the final Product for the consumer.
The Production Flow Although the following example shows a manufacturing process, these flows can also be applied to generic environments where resources are used for tasks that require skills, to achieve a goal.
In order to extract a process sample, the P&amp;amp;Q Factory, shown below, will be used as an example.</description></item><item><title>Times of Gain</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/times-of-gain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/docs/posts/times-of-gain/</guid><description>Stage Model The Stage revised model shows below the Facility resources divided into two categories:
