The market consumers, as the main link of the production line, release the vital energy that generates demand. Then, products and money start to cycle in opposite directions, generating the Gain that feeds bAmpli, the Business Amplifier. The cycling speed, or <strong>Cyclo spin</strong> is determined by the process constraint.</blockquote><div class="book-columns flex flex-wrap"><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79046804-5dd41d00-7be9-11ea-9239-780095caaffb.png alt="Y3 1 Cyclo bw"></p><p>The process hasn&rsquo;t a single time and done behavior. The operations repeats endlessly for each product! Assets always enter a step, are processed for some time and follow to the next step.

This money is used to pay the Raw Materials (RM) used in the process steps. The remaining balance is the Gain (G) which contributes to company&rsquo;s net profit.</p><p>On the other hand, the outer blue arrows leaving Earth to &ldquo;S1&rdquo; represent assets traversing the path in the opposite direction.

The &ldquo;+&rdquo; symbol at the top represents the investor. In addition to the plan, the system also captures the naked Reality. The function of the Administration is to confront Plan & Reality, promoting the actions of managers and investors that will fix the differences. Operating Expense should cover the Labor and Overhead expenses.</p><p>Administration has &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; inputs, respectively for plan & reality feedback. The Cyclo is expected to happen, which means the positive input. If there is a disparity, an action must be taken. For example, when the Gain is negative, it is necessary to inject Investment, in order to keep Cyclo spinning.
