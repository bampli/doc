Due to unitary <strong>gpi</strong>, this time is all used in the process to manufacture P and Q at the highest quality and speed possible. More details about the P&Q Factory that make life easier to investors and managers:</p><ul><li><strong>Sales</strong>: There is no difficulty in moving the P&Q products because the market
has potential to buy up to 100 pieces of P and 50 pieces of Q per week.</li><li><strong>Prices</strong>: The unit prices are preset at $90 for P and $100 for Q. If production exceeds market volume limits, the products become stranded.</li><li><strong>Operating Expenses</strong>: There are no surprises for fixed costs, since Operating Expenses are immutable $6,000 per week, including Workforce and Overhead.</li><li><strong>Raw Materials</strong>: The raw materials used in the process are P-Part, RM1, RM2, and RM3, at costs respectively of $5, $20, $20 and $20, with no surprises.</li><li><strong>Workforce</strong>: The P&Q Factory has four workers with different <strong>skills</strong>: A, B, C, and D. They are absolutely perfect workers during all the working time. No delays, no errors.</li></ul><h2 id=pq-process>P&Q Process</h2><p>The engineering of the P&Q Factory presents the <em>manufacturing</em> process in the following diagram, showing the production flows that result in P and Q. These flows could also be applied to other <em>environments</em> where <strong>resources</strong> are used for <strong>tasks</strong> that require <strong>skills</strong>, to achieve a <strong>goal</strong>.</p><script src=/docs/mermaid.min.js></script><script>mermaid.initialize({flowchart:{useMaxWidth:true}});</script><p class=mermaid>graph LR

It is finished by D that assembles product P using the purchased P-Part.</p><p>The middle flow starts with RM2 being processed by B for 15 minutes, continue to C workstation for 5 minutes and may reach both assembly tasks done by D. This central flow is used in both P and Q fabrication. To manufacture one of each, it is necessary to process RM2 twice by B and C.</p><p>Lastly, RM3 spends 10 minutes being processed by A, then is processed for 15 minutes by B and goes to Q assembly workstation. D assembles P and Q in respectively 15 and 5 minutes.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-net-profit-of-the-pq-factory>What is the net profit of the P&Q Factory?</h2><p>What is the maximum net profit that P&Q Factory can earn per week?
