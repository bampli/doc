More details about the P&Q Factory that make life easier to investors and managers:</p><ul><li><strong>Sales</strong>: There is no difficulty in moving the P&Q products because the market
has potential to buy up to 100 pieces of P and 50 pieces of Q per week.</li><li><strong>Prices</strong>: The unit prices are preset at $90 for P and $100 for Q. If production exceeds market limits, products become stranded.</li><li><strong>Operating Expenses</strong>: There are no surprises for fixed costs, since Operating Expenses are immutable $6,000 per week, including Workforce and Overhead.</li><li><strong>Raw Materials</strong>: The raw materials used in the process are P-Part, RM1, RM2, and RM3, at costs respectively of $5, $20, $20 and $20, with no surprises.</li><li><strong>Stages</strong>: The P&Q Factory process consists of four Stages: A, B, C, and D.</li></ul><h2 id=pq-manufacturing-process>P&Q Manufacturing Process</h2><p>The engineering of the P&Q Factory presents the manufacturing process in the following diagram, showing the production flows that result in P and Q.</p><script src=/mermaid.min.js></script><script>mermaid.initialize({flowchart:{useMaxWidth:true}});</script><p class=mermaid>graph LR

This central flow is used in both P and Q fabrication. To manufacture one of each, it is necessary to process RM2 twice through B and C.</p><p>Lastly, RM3 spends 10 minutes in Stage A, then is processed for 15 minutes in Stage B and goes to Q assembly at Stage D.
