Applying his knowledge, he elaborates a process that transforms market-acquired raw materials into products he intends to sell. In the beginning, he is the do-everything. Buy, produce, sell, invoice, pay and receive. Market acceptance is good and sales grow rapidly, driven by word of mouth from satisfied customers.
The diagram below represents this stage of business, where the investor is very close to everything and everyone.</description></item><item><title>The Process</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/posts/process/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/posts/process/</guid><description>Based on the original Deming&amp;rsquo;s process definition:
The Process would be divided into stages; the work would enter a certain stage, change state and continue, having as client the next stage. The final step would be for the user, buyer of the product or service. At each stage there would be production, that is, something would happen in the assets that enter the stage, causing its exit in a different state.</description></item><item><title>The Financial Indicators</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/posts/indicators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/posts/indicators/</guid><description>Inspired on Goldratt&amp;rsquo;s indicators for the Theory of Constraints, the Financial Indicators are listed below. The simplicity of the equations is vital to their general acceptance and understanding. This is the basic financial information that companies of any type and size should maintain.
Financial Indicators Initials Indicator Description RI Return on Investment Equals Net Profit divided by Investment. I Investment It is all the money the system invests by buying Inventory that the system intends to sell.</description></item><item><title>TPM: Total Productive Maintenance</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/posts/tpm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/posts/tpm/</guid><description>TPM consists of a systematic program for enterprise development that addresses maintenance by optimizing equipment effectiveness. TPM consolidates failures and waste into a creative approach, using time as a common link.
Thus, Working Time is defined as the total journey time that company works. From then on, we will be discounting the time spent on failures and waste, creating indexes that will selectively signal machine and equipment performance problems, operation failures and product defects.</description></item><item><title>The Cyclo</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/posts/cyclo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/posts/cyclo/</guid><description>Gain is the most important measure In order to discuss the Cyclo, it is necessary to assume that Gain is the most important measure when it comes to increase the Net Profit. Check the Net Profit and Gain formulas below:
\( \begin{aligned} NP&amp;=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\ G&amp;=PS-RM \\ \end{aligned} \) NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead
Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses.</description></item><item><title>Company &amp; Planet</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/posts/company-planet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/posts/company-planet/</guid><description>The Company and the Planet The following relationships rule the interaction between the Company and the Planet. COMPANY The Company has Investors that own Shares that decide how to manage a Facility that implements a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more. PLANET The Planet is made of Processes expressed by bAmpli Circuits with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more.</description></item><item><title>P&amp;Q Factory</title><link>https://bampli.github.io/posts/pq-factory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bampli.github.io/posts/pq-factory/</guid><description>This is the Process used as a sample when a process is needed in this project.
The P&amp;amp;Q Factory gives no room for apology and demonstrates how the &amp;ldquo;Theory of Constraints&amp;rdquo; can help managers with their decision-making logic. The fictional factory portfolio has products P &amp;amp; Q.
P&amp;amp;Q Factory Using TPM to describe the P&amp;amp;Q Factory, there is little reason to blame poor corporate results:
ati = 1 Equipment runs nonstop for the working time, available time index is 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
