Applying his knowledge, he elaborates a process that transforms market-acquired raw materials into products he intends to sell. In the beginning, he is the do-everything. Buy, produce, sell, invoice, pay and receive. Market acceptance is good and sales grow rapidly, driven by word of mouth from satisfied customers.
The diagram below represents this stage of business, where the investor is very close to everything and everyone.

The Process would be divided into stages; the work would enter a certain stage, change state and continue, having as client the next stage. The final step would be for the user, buyer of the product or service, the main link of the production line. At each stage there would be production, that is, something would happen in the assets that enter the stage, causing its exit in a different state.

The simplicity of the equations is vital to their general acceptance and understanding. This is the basic financial information that companies of any type and size should maintain.

TPM consolidates failures and waste into a creative approach, using time as a common link.
Thus, Working Time is defined as the total journey time that company works. From then on, we will be discounting the time spent on failures and waste, creating indexes that will selectively signal machine and equipment performance problems, operation failures and product defects.

Check the Net Profit and Gain formulas below:
\( \begin{aligned} NP&=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\ G&=PS-RM \\ \end{aligned} \) NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead
Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses.

COMPANY The Company has Investors that own Shares that decide how to manage a Facility that implements a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more. PLANET The Planet is a living System populated by cooperative Work made by a Process expressed by a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more.

The P&Q Factory gives no room for apology and demonstrates how the &ldquo;Theory of Constraints&rdquo; can help managers with their decision-making logic. The fictional factory portfolio has products P & Q.
P&Q Factory Using TPM to describe the P&Q Factory, there is little reason to blame poor corporate results:
ati = 1 Equipment runs nonstop for the working time, available time index is 1.

The Production Flow Although the following example shows a manufacturing process, these flows can also be applied to generic environments where resources are used for tasks that require skills, to achieve a goal.
In order to extract a process sample, the P&Q Factory, shown below, will be used as an example.
