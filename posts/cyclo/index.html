To try to prove that, let&rsquo;s start with the Net Profit and Gain formulas shown below:</p><link rel=stylesheet href=/docs/katex/katex.min.css><script defer src=/docs/katex/katex.min.js></script><script defer src=/docs/katex/auto-render.min.js onload=renderMathInElement(document.body);></script><span class=katex>\(
\begin{aligned}
NP&=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\
   G&=PS-RM \\
\end{aligned}
\)</span><p>NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead</p><p>Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses. But which expense to cut, if almost everything is important? From a certain point, it becomes difficult to keep reducing costs. Even supposing it is possible to overstate all costs, the total amount would at most go down to zero. That is, the reduction strategy is limited by the simple fact that costs are finite.</p><p>The Product Sales is the only term that contributes positively to the Net Profit. Unlike costs, sales volume has no limits, i.e. the sky is the limit! Are you already convinced? If not, please read more about it on Goldratt&rsquo;s literature.</p><p>Why choosing <strong>G</strong> and not <strong>PS</strong>? Please note that Product Sales is intimately tied to the Raw Material. One doesn&rsquo;t live without the other, since for every sale it is necessary to invest in the raw materials used to build the product.</p><p>Since Gain is the most important measure, how to increase it? How can we at least guarantee that it will not decrease? The Gain only happens when there is a sale. What can facilitate or prevent a sale from occurring? Considering the Deming&rsquo;s process specification, for a sale to happen, the product must go through all the <strong>Stages</strong> of the <strong>Process</strong>. We also know that in a chain of actions, the performance is determined by the strength of its weakest link.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>This project is published in <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Business-Amplifier-M-Sc-Motta-Lopes/dp/B083XGK14Q>Business Amplifier</a>, also <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Business-Amplifier-Jose-Motta-Lopes-ebook-dp-B086L6V6QY/dp/B086L6V6QY/>e-book</a> and <a href=https://www.amazon.com/M-Sc-Jose-Motta-Lopes/dp/8592301009>Amplificador de Negócios</a>.</strong></blockquote></p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex justify-between"></div></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#gain-is-the-most-important-measure>Gain is the most important measure</a></li></ul></nav></aside></main></body></html>
