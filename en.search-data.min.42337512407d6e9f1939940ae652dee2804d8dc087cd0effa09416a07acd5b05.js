Applying his knowledge, he elaborates a process that transforms market-acquired raw materials into products he intends to sell. In the beginning, he is the do-everything. Buy, produce, sell, invoice, pay and receive. Market acceptance is good and sales grow rapidly, driven by word of mouth from satisfied customers.\nThe diagram below represents this stage of business, where the investor is very close to everything and everyone. It captures information directly from the process and makes virtually instant decisions, streamlining business operations. Free of distortions in information and decisions, the business is booming.\nAs sales increase, it needs to work harder and harder. It optimizes the process and multiplies to a certain extent. There comes a point where he realizes that he needs to change the way he works. From that moment on, the skilled investor will no longer act as before, as it becomes vital to increase control over the process.\nPyramid Expands Control The investor alters the process and distributes tasks like purchasing, production, sale, billing and receipt among several business managers. In pyramid form, a multilevel structure establishes a hierarchy of managers. Here\u0026rsquo;s a typical diagram:\nAs the business grows, it is necessary to add more levels to the pyramid. Depending on the activities performed, this occurs when the human limit is reached, which usually sets a maximum of fifteen subordinates per person.\nThis structure has been widely employed by various types of organization throughout history. From armies to religions, the hierarchical pyramid is unanimous when it comes to management. Increasing the command power of the investor and managers requires them to relate to the next higher and lower levels. The main duties of managers are:\n Receive and relay investor orders to command the process; Capture process information to keep the investor updated.  The investor\u0026rsquo;s strategy is that each manager has command power over the entire pyramid of subordinates below him. The investor also needs managers to be responsible for capturing and reporting the status of the process.\nObviously, the company must continue to deal with the flow of information and decisions that circulate between the process and the investor. If this flow is interrupted, or even impaired, the company suffers serious risks. Therefore it is paramount that each pyramid manager is able to handle the two pairs of inputs and outputs listed below:\n   Initials Indicator description     Din Decision Entry Order received from boss   Dout Decision Out Order transmitted to subordinates   Iin Information Entry Information received from process   Iout Information Output Information transmitted to the boss    From investor training and command at the top of the pyramid, managers must fulfill their role by guiding their subordinates in conducting the process. Similarly, managers should capture process information, analyze it and inform the investor of relevant facts. Note that each manager has access to the immediate adjacent levels in the pyramid structure, that is, the boss and the subordinates.\nThe manager cycle The diagram below shows in detail the flows of information, analysis, and decision to which each pyramid manager is individually submitted:\n    Initials Indicator description     Ai Information Analysis Manager evaluates process operation   Ad Decision Analysis Manager interprets command decision       The green arrows represent the path taken by the information. The subordinates cause the information originated in the process to be propagated through the pyramid until it reaches input Iin. It is the manager\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to perform the Ai analysis of the received information, before passing it on to his/her immediate boss through the Iout exit. Accordingly, the information is expected to follow its path towards the investor, located at the top of the pyramid. The orange arrows express the Investor\u0026rsquo;s command to be propagated through the pyramid structure until it reaches the process. Thus, decisions made at the upper echelons of the company are expected to result in immediate management orders received at Din. The manager must perform the Ad analysis and generate a set of Dout decisions for their subordinates, following company determinations. The yellow arrows reflect audits performed by good managers. By reporting Iout information to the immediate boss, the manager may anticipate a future investor Din decision. Likewise, after triggering a Dout decision that affects the process, a future reflection on the Iin entry that consolidates the change is expected.  The pyramid distorts info \u0026amp; decisions Undoubtedly, the hierarchical pyramid solves the investor\u0026rsquo;s problem of increasing control over the process. But at what cost? See in the example below that a three-level pyramid requires information and decisions to pass through three managers to reach the investor and the process respectively.\nConsider the investor passing on to his first echelon a decision D that should be directed to the process. At the same time, information I is captured at the lowest level of the pyramid near the process. In the small startup where the investor does everything, there is no distortion in decision and information, the contact is direct.\nIn the hierarchical manager structure, only level 1 managers receive the \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; investor decision D. They will then analyze and relay the D1out decision to the second level, taking into account the interpretation of how the D decision should be implemented by their subordinates. See below the equation as it looks:\nD1out = D1in. A1d = D. A1d = D2in\nRepeating the reasoning for a hierarchical structure of managers with n levels, the decision that will arrive at the process can be calculated as follows:\nD-Process = D-Investor . A1d . A2d . A3d \u0026hellip; And\nSimilarly, \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; information is captured by the third-tier manager. It performs A3i information analysis and transmits the resulting information to its boss\u0026rsquo;s I2in input at level 2:\nI3out = I3in. A3i = I. A3i = I2in\nConsidering the analyzes propagated by the managers of each level, the information will reach the top of a n-level pyramid with the following interferences:\nI-Investor = I-Process . A1i . A2i . A3i \u0026hellip; Ani\nThen, there are interferences in decisions and information, represented by A1d, A2d, \u0026hellip;, And and A1i, A2i, \u0026hellip;, Ani, respectively the decision and information analysis that have been applied by managers, at their respective pyramid levels.\nDistortions in information and decisions are proportional to the number of levels in the hierarchical pyramid. Higher the pyramid, greater the likelihood that information and decisions will be distorted.\nThe conflict in the pyramid Apparently there is a conflict in the hierarchical structure of managers:\n The pyramid extends command and information capture between the investor and the process. To enlarge, one must add levels to the pyramid; The pyramid distorts information and decisions that circulate between the investor and the process. To avoid, reduce the levels of the pyramid.  The conflict diagram There is a template commonly used for conflict analysis, known by the cloud evaporating method. The name suggests that the dark clouds that float above your head just evaporate magically. Let\u0026rsquo;s apply it to the hierarchical manager pyramid conflict and deeply analyse each one of its parts.\nThe conflict analysis For the investor to be successful with the process, it is necessary to increase control as well as to avoid distortions in information and decisions. Both are fundamental requirements for the intended success. Analyzing remaining components individually:\n Increasing control has as a prerequisite increasing levels in the manager hierarchy. There are no much reasons to doubt this, given the small business previous experience. To avoid distortions of information and decisions, you should limit the height of the pyramid, i.e. have fewer levels. One prerequisite is the opposite of the other, as indicated by the red arrow in the diagram.  How to solve this dilemma? Would it be better to favor one side? Or displease them both and stand on the fence? Another option would be to go for a magical solution that pleases both sides and evaporates the conflict. Is it possible to identify the weak point of the conflict by looking carefully at each arrow in the diagram?\nFor example, increased investor control and the absence of misstatements in manager information and decisions are vital to a company\u0026rsquo;s success. Neither of these two requirements can be waived.\nAnother strong arrow is that of conflict itself, as you cannot raise and lower levels at the same time. That leaves two arrows to analyze:\n increase levels to expand control decrease levels to avoid distortions  Which is the weakest point of the conflict? To answer that, ask yourself:\n Can you extend control without increasing pyramid levels? Difficult, given the human limitations to manage more than fifteen subordinates. How to avoid distortions in information and decisions without lowering the levels of the pyramid? What if there was a measure that would guide managers?  The solution of the conflict in the hierarchical pyramid is to find the right measure to help investors and managers to avoid distortions in their decisions and in the analysis of process information.\nMeasures evolution Every 30 years, since the 1920s, there have been major changes in the measures that guide corporate investors and managers. See in the table below that the ranking of the measures presents differences during the evolution occurred in the western and eastern countries. Since the mid-twentieth century, due to fierce competition, the right management philosophy has determined success for the winning side.\nLooking at the company\u0026rsquo;s Net Profit formula below, it can be seen that virtually all of its terms are costs, except for Product Sales.\n  \\( \\begin{aligned} NP\u0026=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\)  NP: Net Profit; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead\nCosts also represent most of the company\u0026rsquo;s accounting entries. Cost Accounting has met challenges in two World Wars, occupying the #1 rank since the 1920s. Cost reduction was what most influenced investors and managers around the world to increase Net Profit. However, the fundamentals of Cost Accounting have been shaken over time and terms like \u0026ldquo;product profit margin\u0026rdquo; lost their meaning.\nThe quality revolution started by Deming in Japan in the 1950s corroborated Kaizen, a concept of Japanese culture that other languages need two words to express: continuous improvement. In the 1970s, while Toyota was evolving Just in Time at full speed, Western companies still preferred to insist on Cost Accounting, seeking sophisticated correlations between fixed costs, products and the process. The Japanese opted for Return on Investment as measure #1, highlighting the difference between Eastern and Western decision-support philosophies. The result was the Japanese buying New York in the 80\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me how you measure me, and I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you how I will behave.\u0026rdquo; This phrase by Israeli physicist Eli Goldratt, creator of Theory of Constraints, stressed the importance of choosing the right measure to guide investors and managers. He turned the game on Westerners after promoting Gain to Measure #1.\nHe used the Net Profit formula to convince everyone that managing the cost world was very information-dependent. All terms are costs, he exaggerated. What expense to cut if everything is important? We are drowning in a sea of data, complaining about the lack of information!\nWith the world of gains, Goldratt changed the paradigm, obsessively focusing on the analysis of product sales. It\u0026rsquo;s the only term that contributes positively to the Net Profit equation, he said. Unlike cost savings, Gain has no limits. That is, the sky is the limit.\nAmpli Business In order to guide investors and managers in their decisions towards the global optimum, an Information System model consisting of simple combined elements that express management and management best practices is needed. Ampli Business proposes a four-tiered standardization effort:\n Company Indicators Cyclo: The Gain Machine bAmpli: Business Amplifier bAmpli Circuits  Just looking at the following bAmpli Circuit below with 4 Cyclos, it is known that:\n The investor is represented by the green “+” at the top left of the circuit; He invests in a bAmpli Business Circuit, made up of Cyclos numbered 1 through 4; The bAmpli responsible for Cyclo 1 supports the business of Cyclos 2 and 3; bAmplis from Cyclos 2 and 3 share their Profit; And reinvest it in the Cyclo 4.  This 4-Cyclos bAmpli Circuit expects to make a profit to be returned to its investor, i.e. the green “+” at the top left of the circuit. This project expects to develop the Ampli Business components.\nThis project is published in Business Amplifier, also e-book and Amplificador de Negócios.

"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/posts/tpm/','title':"TPM: Total Productive Maintenance",'content':"TPM consists of a systematic program for enterprise development that addresses maintenance by optimizing equipment effectiveness. TPM consolidates failures and waste into a creative approach, using time as a common link.\nThus, Working Time is defined as the total journey time that company works. From then on, we will be discounting the time spent on failures and waste, creating indexes that will selectively signal machine and equipment performance problems, operation failures and product defects.\nAvailable Time Index (ati) Given the Working Time, extract the Downtime, which is the time that machines or equipment failed, preventing production from occur. The remaining time, i.e. when the machines and equipment are running, is called Available Time. See in the following diagram that the available time index (ati) equals the Available Time divided by Working Time.\nOperating Time Index (oti) From Available Time is now subtracted the production Breakdown Time, which represents operational waste, staff shortages or operational failure. The remaining time is called Operating Time. The operating time index (oti) is obtained by dividing the Operating Time by the Available Time.\nOperational Performance Index (opi) Operating Speed indicates how close the process has come to the theoretical production cycle. See that the effective cycle is calculated by dividing Productive Time by the number of products produced. Then, the theoretical cycle is divided by the effective cycle to obtain the Operating Speed index (osi).\nIn calculating the Operational Performance Index (opi) below, the Productive Time Index is multiplied by the Operating Speed. In the numerator the Productive Time is replaced by the total quantity of products multiplied by the effective cycle. With this, we extract from Operating Time the loss of operational speed of production. The remaining time is called Productive Time.\nZero Defect Index (zti) Considering the product quality, the Productive Time is deducted from the time spent reworking defective products, creating the Zero Defect Time (zti) index. At this time, the production system worked fully, with no downtimes, breakdowns, defects, or rework to fix them.\nGlobal Performance Index (gpi) Finally, the company\u0026rsquo;s Global Performance is achieved by multiplying the four indices of Available Time, Operating Time, Operating Performance and Zero Defect. Here\u0026rsquo;s the equation that results in the Global Performance Index (gpi).\n  \\( \\begin{aligned} gpi\u0026=ati * oti * opi * zti \\end{aligned} \\)  Following is a summary of the TPM indices:\n Available Time Index (ati) : Equivalent to Available Time divided by Working Time, that is, the amount of time that machines and equipment do not fail and production can occur. Operating Time Index (oti) : Equals Operating Time divided by Available Time. Considers the portion of time without a breakdown in production, due to lack of personnel or failure in operation. Operational Performance Index (opi) : This is equivalent to the multiplication of Operating Speed by the Production Time Index, reflecting the production operational speed losses. Zero Defect Index (zti) : Equivalent to Zero Defect Time, which produced only perfect products, divided by Productive Time, ie represents the portion of time free from rework on defective products. Global Performance Index (gpi) : This is the multiplication of the four indices above, corresponding to the overall performance, considering the problems caused by eventual failures and waste to which the Process is subject.  The company\u0026rsquo;s overall performance index has intermediate indices that provide a selective and detailed analysis of the sources of problems. Masterfully, TPM has turned time into a decision support tool that brings together concepts as diverse as stopping machines, wasted labor, and faulty parts.\nProduction Counters For clarification of the formulas, follows the graphical representation of the production counters, including the total of products produced and those that were effectively dispatched. The Process produces np products, of which nz are free of defects, and nw does need rework. Of the latter, nr products are recovered and added to nz, resulting in nd dispatches. The ns unrepaired products are recycled as scratch.\nThis project is published in Business Amplifier, also e-book and Amplificador de Negócios.  "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/posts/cyclo/','title':"The Cyclo",'content':"Gain is the most important measure In order to discuss the Cyclo, it is necessary to assume that Gain is the most important measure when it comes to increase the Net Profit. Check the Net Profit and Gain formulas below:\n  \\( \\begin{aligned} NP\u0026=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\\\ G\u0026=PS-RM \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\)  NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead\nDefinitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses. But which expense to cut, if almost everything is important? From a certain point, it becomes difficult to keep reducing costs. Even supposing it is possible to overstate all costs, the total amount would at most go down to zero. That is, the reduction strategy is limited by the simple fact that costs are finite.\nThe Product Sales is the only term that contributes positively to the Net Profit. Unlike costs, sales volume has no limits, i.e. the sky is the limit!\nAren\u0026rsquo;t you convinced? This demonstration is not the objective here, please read more about it on Business Amplifier, also e-book and Amplificador de Negócios.  Why choosing G and not PS? Please note that Product Sales is intimately tied to Raw Material. One doesn\u0026rsquo;t live without the other, since for every sale it is necessary to invest in the raw materials used to build the product.\nSince Gain is the most important measure, how to increase it? How can we at least guarantee that it will not decrease? The Gain only happens when there is a sale. What can facilitate or prevent a sale from occurring?\nAccording to the Process specification, for a sale to happen, the product should pass through all the Stages of the Process. We know that in a chain of actions, the performance is determined by the strength of its weakest link. This is the main concept behind \u0026ldquo;The Theory of Constraints\u0026rdquo; created by Eli Goldratt in the 80\u0026rsquo;s.\nThe Process cycle To assist investors and managers in decision-making toward the global optimum, relationships between Process Stages, suppliers and consumers need to be further deepened. How to provide first-class support for long-term trusts? Please remind rule six of Deming´s process specification that states: This is what I can do for you; here\u0026rsquo;s what you can do for me.\nThe Process Stages do not have a linear, one-time, and done behavior. The processing sequence repeats endlessly for each new product! Assets always enter in a Stage, are processed for some time and go to the next Stage. It looks like Process acts as n-stroke engine or n-pole generator, where n is the number of Process Stages.\nFor this reason, the tenth rule was added to the Process specification:\nThe Process consumes products of nature and transforms them into other products of nature.  In fact, this rule is nothing new. Raw materials are eventually purchased and entered into a Process that generates products for sale. Joining both ends of the Process with the Earth, everything comes out of Earth, everything comes back to Earth. Products are bought, treated, combined and become other products to be sold.\nIf the goal is globalization, at least the vision of the planet has emerged!\nEach Stage individually contributes to keep the Process Cycle spinning. Together, they should keep up the pace, the teamwork can\u0026rsquo;t stop. The time taken by the slowest Stage is what determines the performance of the process cycle, in this case, the spin or angular speed.\nSpin? What turns? See in the diagram that products and money cycle in opposite directions.\nAt the top, Earth\u0026rsquo;s first green arrow to “Sn” indicates the money from the consumer market that pays for Product Sales (PS). This money is used to pay the Raw Materials (RM) used in the Process Stages. The remaining balance is the Gain (G) which contributes to Company\u0026rsquo;s Net Profit.\nOn the other hand, the outer blue arrows leaving Earth to \u0026ldquo;S1\u0026rdquo; represent assets traversing the path in the opposite direction. Raw materials are purchased, enter into the process, and become products that the company intends to sell.\nThe Stages depend on each other to keep both streams spinning simultaneously:\n Money from selling products to the market by remunerating suppliers. Assets collected in the market being transformed into products sold;  These two streams are closely related, one only happens together with the other. Without payments there are no raw materials in production. Without raw materials there are no revenues. This is crucial for the most important measure to happen!\nThis project is published in Business Amplifier, also e-book and Amplificador de Negócios.

COMPANY  The Company has Investors that own Shares that decide how to manage a Facility that implements a bAmpli Circuit with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more.   PLANET  The Planet is made of Processes expressed by bAmpli Circuits with at least one bAmpli that handles at least one Cyclo composed by one Stage or more.    The following diagram clarifies the Company \u0026amp; Planet containerships. Notes  The Company has Investors that are the shareholders. The Investors own Shares that elect Company\u0026rsquo;s top management. The Facility in this context is not a building! The Facility is a commitment to lend. It is like a credit card that entitles the Company to borrow on demand up to a prearranged limit at a predetermined interest rate. When the Company use the card, it creates an outstanding loan, and each additional charge is a drawdown againts the Facility that increases the loan. Finally the Company pays the loan principal, and may also pay an annual fee for the privilege of having the Facility, independently of the loan. This definition is inspired by Eric Evans \u0026ldquo;Domain Driven Design\u0026rdquo; book, shown at chapter eight. The Facility implements a bAmpli Circuit designed to fullfill Company\u0026rsquo;s Process. The bAmpli Circuit is an abstraction that maybe implemented by different Companies. It is like an electronic circuit schematic that may be applied to different equipment. The bAmpli Circuit is composed of at least one bAmpli, or Business Amplifier. The bAmpli is responsible for at least one Cyclo, or Gain Machine. The Cyclo is composed of at least one Stage.  Financial Indicators    Initials Indicator Description     RI Return on Investment At initial version, RI is returned to Investors according to their Shares. This simple rule maybe extended in future versions.   I Investment It is all the money that the Facility invests by buying Inventory that will be converted into sales.   NP Net Profit This is the Company NP, considering all the existing bAmpli Circuits inside the Facility.   PS Product Sales It is the cash flow received from the sale of products from each existing Cyclo inside the Facility.   RM Raw Material It is the cash flow that remunerate suppliers from each existing Cyclo inside the Facility.   G Gain This is the rate at which the system generates money through sales. Equals revenue from Product Sales minus Raw Material expenses from each Cyclo inside the Facility.   WF Workforce Company expenses with Labor, related to all bAmpli Circuits that exist in the Facility.   OH Overhead Other fixed costs of the Company, also related to all bAmpli Circuits that exist in the Facility.   OE Operating Expense It is all the money the system spends turning Inventory into Gain.

The fictional factory portfolio has products P \u0026amp; Q.\nP\u0026amp;Q Factory Using TPM to describe the P\u0026amp;Q Factory, there is little reason to blame poor corporate results:\n ati = 1 Equipment runs nonstop for the working time, available time index is 1. oti = 1 There is no break in the operation, operating time index is 1. opi = 1 There is no speed loss, operational performance index is 1. zti = 1 There are no defective products, then zero defect index is 1. gpi = 1 Multiply above indexes to get the P\u0026amp;Q global performance index of 1.  Using the week as a unit, the factory\u0026rsquo;s working time is 2,400 minutes per week. Due to unitary gpi, this time is all used in the process to manufacture P and Q at the highest quality and speed possible. More details about the P\u0026amp;Q Factory that make life easier to investors and managers:\n Sales: There is no difficulty in moving the P\u0026amp;Q products because the market has potential to buy up to 100 pieces of P and 50 pieces of Q per week. Prices: The unit prices are preset at $90 for P and $100 for Q. If production exceeds market limits, products become stranded. Operating Expenses: There are no surprises for fixed costs, since Operating Expenses are immutable $6,000 per week, including Workforce and Overhead. Raw Materials: The raw materials used in the process are P-Part, RM1, RM2, and RM3, at costs respectively of $5, $20, $20 and $20, with no surprises. Stages: The P\u0026amp;Q Factory process consists of four Stages: A, B, C, and D.  P\u0026amp;Q Manufacturing Process The engineering of the P\u0026amp;Q Factory presents the manufacturing process in the following diagram, showing the production flows that result in P and Q.\n  mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth:true } });  graph LR PP[P-Part $5/u] -- D1[D 15min/u] -- P[P $90/u 100u/wk] RM1[RM1 $20/u] -- A1[A 15min/u] -- C1[C 10min/u] -- D1 RM2[RM2 $20/u] -- B2[B 15min/u] -- C2[C 5min/u] -- D1 C2 -- D2[D] RM3[RM3 $20/u] -- A3[A 10min/u] -- B3[B 15min/u] -- D2[D 5min/u] -- Q[Q $100/U 50u/wk]   \\( \\begin{gathered} wk\u0026=2400\\,min \\qquad OE\u0026=\\$6000/wk \\end{gathered} \\)  As shown in the top of the diagram, RM1 enters Stage A, takes 15 minutes processing, then goes to Stage C for 10 minutes and ends in Stage D, which assembles product P with P-Part.\nThe middle flow starts with RM2 being processed in Stage B for 15 minutes, continuing to Stage C for 5 minutes and reaching both assembly steps D. This central flow is used in both P and Q fabrication. To manufacture one of each, it is necessary to process RM2 twice through B and C.\nLastly, RM3 spends 10 minutes in Stage A, then is processed for 15 minutes in Stage B and goes to Q assembly at Stage D. P\u0026amp;Q mounting Stages D are processed in respectively 15 and 5 minutes.\nHow much profit does the P\u0026amp;Q Factory? What is the maximum Net Profit that P\u0026amp;Q Factory can earn per week? Think about the time each stage has for producing P and Q.\nThis exercise, created by Eli Goldratt, was first published in the book \u0026ldquo;The Haystack Syndrome\u0026rdquo;.
