## Gain is the most important measure

In order to discuss the **Cyclo**, it is necessary to assume that **Gain** is the most important measure when it comes to increase the Net Profit. This demonstration is not the objective here, but consider the Net Profit and Gain formulas below:

{{< katex >}}
\begin{aligned}
   NP&=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\
   G&=PS-RM \\
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead

Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses. But which expense to cut, if almost everything is important? From a certain point, it becomes difficult to keep reducing costs. Even supposing it is possible to overstate all costs, the total amount would at most go down to zero. That is, the reduction strategy is limited by the simple fact that costs are finite.

The Product Sales is the only term that contributes positively to the Net Profit. Unlike costs, sales volume has no limits, i.e. the sky is the limit! Are you already convinced? If not, please read more about it on Goldratt's literature.

Why choosing **G** and not **PS**? Please note that Product Sales is intimately tied to the Raw Material. One doesn't live without the other, since for every sale it is necessary to invest in the raw materials used to build the product.

Since Gain is the most important measure, how to increase it? How can we at least guarantee that it will not decrease? The Gain only happens when there is a sale. What can facilitate or prevent a sale from occurring? According to the process specification, for a sale to happen the product should pass through all the **Stages** of the **Process**. We know that in a chain of actions, the performance is determined by the strength of its weakest link.

## The Process cycle

However, to assist investors and managers in decision-making toward the global optimum, relationships between Process Stages, suppliers and consumers need to be further deepened. How to provide first-class support for long-term trusts? Please remind rule six of Deming´s process specification: This is what I can do for you; here's what you can do for me.

For this reason, the tenth rule was added to the Process specification:

10. **The Process consumes products of nature and transforms them into other products of nature**.

In fact, this rule is nothing new. Raw materials are eventually purchased
and entered into a Process that generates products for sale. Joining both
ends of the Process with the Earth, everything comes out of Earth,
everything comes back to Earth. Products are bought, treated, combined
and become other products to be sold.

If the goal is globalization, at least the vision of the planet has emerged!

The Process Stages do not have a linear, one-time, and done behavior. The processing sequence repeats endlessly for each new product! Assets always enter in a Stage, are processed for some time and go to the next Stage. It looks like Process acts as n-stroke engine or n-pole generator, where n is the number of Process Stages.

Each Stage individually contributes to keep the Process Cycle spinning. Everyone needs to keep up the pace, the teamwork can't stop. The time taken by the slowest step is what determines the performance of the process cycle, in this case, the spin speed. Spin? What turns? See in the following diagram that products and money cycle in
opposite directions.
