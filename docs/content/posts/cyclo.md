The Information System model has so far brought together valuable allies, incorporating concepts originating from SPC, JIT, TPM, and TOC into one of the most powerful combinations of decision support tools ever assembled in history.

However, to assist investors and managers in decision-making toward the global optimum, relationships between Process Stages, suppliers and consumers need to be further deepened. How to provide first-class support
for long-term trusts? Please remind rule six of Deming´s process specification: This is what I can do for you; here's what you can do for me.

## Gain is the most important measure

In order to discuss the **Cyclo**, it is also necessary to assume that **Gain** is the most important measure when it comes to increasing the Net Profit. To try to prove that, let's start with the Net Profit and Gain formulas shown below:

{{< katex >}}
\begin{aligned}
   NP&=(PS-RM)-(WF+OH) \\
   G&=PS-RM \\
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

NP: Net Profit; G: Gain; PS: Product Sales; RM: Raw Material; WF: Workforce; OH: Overhead

Definitely, it is possible to improve NP just by decreasing any of the expenses. But which expense to cut, if almost everything is important? From a certain point, it becomes difficult to keep reducing costs. Even supposing it is possible to overstate all costs, the total amount would at most go down to zero. That is, the reduction strategy is limited by the simple fact that costs are finite.

The Product Sales is the only term that contributes positively to the Net Profit. Unlike costs, sales volume has no limits, i.e. the sky is the limit! Are you already convinced? If not, please read more about it on Goldratt's literature.

Why choosing **G** and not **PS**? Please note that Product Sales is intimately tied to the Raw Material. One doesn't live without the other, since for every sale it is necessary to invest in the raw materials used to build the product.

Since Gain is the most important measure, how to increase it? How can we at least guarantee that it will not decrease? The Gain only happens when there is a sale. What can facilitate or prevent a sale from occurring? Considering the Deming's process specification, for a sale to happen, the product must go through all the **Stages** of the **Process**. We also know that in a chain of actions, the performance is determined by the strength of its weakest link.
