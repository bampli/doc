According to the original Deming's process:

*The Process would be divided into stages; the work would enter a certain stage, change state and continue, having as client the next stage. The final step would be for the user, buyer of the product or service. At each stage there would be production, that is, something would happen in the assets that enter the stage, causing its exit in a different state.*

The rules shown below establish the process specification.

## PROCESS

Step 1 ► Step 2 ► ... ► Consumer

1. **The process is divided into Steps**;
2. **The work enters a Step, changes state, and proceeds with the next Step as a client**;
3. **At each Step there is production, that is, something happens in the set of assets that enter a Step, causing their exit in a different state**;
4. **Each Step incorporates continual improvement of methods and procedures to meet subsequent Steps**;
5. **Each Step cooperates with the next and the previous, seeking optimization**;
6. **The Steps establish long-term trust relationships, such as: This is what I can do for you; Here's what you can do for me**;
7. **The final Step is for the consumer, purchaser of the product or service**;
8. **The Steps work together, aiming at quality and customer satisfaction**;
9. **Consumer is the main link of the production line**;
10. **The Process is a closed loop that consumes products of nature and transforms them into other products of nature**.

### Notes

- The Steps are designed according to the skills and workflows required by the Process;
- Each Step incorporates a process of continuous improvement, or kaizen;
- With the assistance of SPC, JIT, TPM and TOC, management shall establish operational definitions related to the Process;
- Management should perform sampling, measurement and drawing of control charts that assess the quality of production;
- In order to clarify that a cyclic behaviour is expected, a tenth rule is added, as a consequence of rules number six and seven.
