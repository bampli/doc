# Ampli Business. It makes sense.

## What to change?

The decision-making of all companies has been solely based on **conflict management**. This problem starts with the structure of organizations, where  information and decision flow through a hierarchical **pyramid structure**.

![X 9 2 manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79045595-54938200-7be2-11ea-94c5-375d57f7ec1d.png)

The weak point of this approach is that each manager is  solely responsible for preventing the propagation of errors, whether in the information coming from the process at bottom, or decisions emanated by investors at the top.

**THE SUM OF THE LOCAL OPTIMA ALMOST ALWAYS TAKES US AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL GREAT.**

In the middle of pyramid, the managers compete with each other, trying to pursue its local best. As a result, distortions in the information and decisions geopardize the company. Higher the hierarchical pyramid, greater the risk of distortions.

## To what to change?

Every 30 years, since the invention of Henry Ford's **factory process** one century ago in 1920, there have been major transformations in process management.

William Deming in the 50's started a revolution in Asian countries with the  **Statistical Process Control**, followed by **Just inTime** introduced by Toyota, and **Total Productive Maintenance** created by Seiichi Nakajima.

In the 80's, Eli Goldratt, author of the literary success "The Goal", brought Westerners back to the top with the widely used **Theory of Constraints**.

These initiatives had so far brought together valuable allies. Incorporating concepts originated from **SPC**, **JIT**, **TPM**, and **TOC** leads to one of the most powerful combinations of decision support tools ever assembled in history.

## How to change?

To tackle current problems head-on, it is necessary to avoid wasting energy by managing conflicts between competing departments, companies, countries, continents, and so on. How to provide first-class support for **long-term trusts**, as required by Deming's process spec?

**THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU; HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME.**

The challenge of creating a system to explore one bottleneck at a time would be rewarded by **kaizen**, a huge concentration of efforts in the continuous improvement towards the great global.

This project presents **Ampli Business**, an information system organized in layers, that establish an **ubiquitous language** to assist companies of all types & sizes involved in making **business decisions**.

The Cyclo is a new rule added to the Deming’s process specification: **The process is a closed loop that consumes product from nature and transforms them into other products of nature**. Showing why they are the main link of the production line, the consumers release the vital energy that generates the product demand. Cycling at a speed determined by the process constraint, products and money start to spin in opposite directions, resulting in the Gain that powers bAmpli, the Business Amplifier.

The operation of the Process does not have a one-time and done behavior. The processing repeats endlessly for each product! Assets are always entered, processed for some time and follow to the next step, simultaneously, like a n-stroke engine.

At the top, Earth's first arrow to “Sn” indicates the money from the consumer market that pays for Product Sales (PS). This money is used to pay the Raw Materials (RM) used in the process steps. The remaining balance is the Gain (G) which contributes to the net profit of the company.

On the other hand, the outer arrows leaving Earth to "S1" represent the assets that traverse the path in the opposite direction. Raw materials are purchased from the market, enter into the Process, and become products that the company intends to sell.

The Plan consists of managing Cyclos feeding the company with their respective Gains. The "+" symbol at the top represents the investor. In addition to the plan, the system also captures the naked Reality. The function of the Administration is to confront Plan & Reality, promoting the actions of managers and investors to fix any differences. Operating Expense should be fed into to  cover Labor and Overhead expenses.

Administration has "+" and "-" entries, where respectively Plan & Reality come in. Cyclo is what is expected to happen, or the positive input. If there is a disparity, an action must be taken. For example, when the Gain is negative, it is necessary to inject Investment, in order to keep Cyclo spinning. This maybe not expected but it happens!

**Ampli Business Circuits allow the development of unlimited Cyclo and bAmpli topologies. They help investors and managers, at every level of the company, at any time, to have access to the global vision of the organization, and its role in globalization.**

## bAmpli Circuits

At the upper level, Business Ampliers may be grouped to form **bAmpli Circuits**. For example, the circuit shows the bAmpli on the left providing investments to leverage three other bAmplis with distinct Cyclos. It can represent an Angel investing in Startups, for example.

In this case, when the Angel sells its “product”, the entire Startup is negotiated, disappearing from the diagram and fattening the Angel's net profit!
