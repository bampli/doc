# Ampli Business. It makes sense.

{{< columns >}}

## What to change?

The decision-making of all companies has been solely based on **conflict management**. The problem starts with the structure of organizations, where  information and decision flow through a hierarchical **pyramid structure**.

![X 9 2 manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79045595-54938200-7be2-11ea-94c5-375d57f7ec1d.png)

The weak point of this approach is that each manager is  solely responsible for preventing the propagation of errors, whether in the information coming from the process, or decisions emanated by investors at the top.

**THE SUM OF THE LOCAL OPTIMA ALMOST ALWAYS TAKES US AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL GREAT.**

In the middle of pyramid, the managers compete with each other, trying to pursue their local best. As a result, distortions in information and decision geopardize the company. Higher the hierarchical pyramid, greater the risk of distortions.

## To what to change?

Every 30 years, since the invention of Henry Ford's **factory process** one century ago in 1920, there have been major transformations in process management.

William Deming in the 50's started a revolution in Asian countries with the  **Statistical Process Control**, followed by **Just inTime** introduced by Toyota, and **Total Productive Maintenance** created by Seiichi Nakajima.

In the 80's, Eli Goldratt, author of the literary success "The Goal", brought Westerners back to the top with the widely used **Theory of Constraints**.

These initiatives had so far brought together valuable allies. Incorporating concepts originated from **SPC**, **JIT**, **TPM**, and **TOC** leads to one of the most powerful combinations of decision support tools ever assembled in history.

## How to change?

To tackle current problems head-on, it is necessary to avoid wasting energy by managing conflicts between competing departments, companies, countries, continents, and so on. How to provide first-class support for **long-term trusts**, according to Deming's rules?

**THIS IS WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU; HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME.**

The challenge of creating a system to explore one bottleneck at a time would be rewarded by **kaizen**, a huge concentration of efforts in the continuous improvement towards the great global.

This project presents **Ampli Business**, an information system organized in layers that establishes an **ubiquitous language** to assist companies of all types & sizes involved in making **business decisions**.

**The Cyclo generates the Gain that feeds bAmpli, the Business Amplifier. The speed is determined by the Process constraint.**

## Cyclo: Gain Machine

Every process step hasn't a single-time-and-done behavior. The operations in each step repeat endlessly for each product! Assets enter a step, are processed for some time and follow to the next step. All steps work simultaneously, similar to a n-stroke engine.

The **Cyclo** adds a rule to the Deming’s process specification stating that "**The process consumes product from nature and transforms them into other products of nature**".

![Y3 1 Cyclo bw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79046804-5dd41d00-7be9-11ea-9239-780095caaffb.png)

The market consumers, as the main link of the production line, release the vital energy that generates demand. Then, products and money start to cycle in opposite directions, generating  the Gain that feeds bAmpli, the Business Amplifier. The cycling speed, or **Cyclo spin** is determined by the process constraint.

## bAmpli: Business Amplifier

The Plan consists of managing a **Cyclo** feeding the **bAmpli** with its respective **Gain**. The "**+**" symbol at the top represents the investor. In addition to the Plan, the system also captures the naked Reality.

The role of the Administration is to confront **Plan** & **Reality**, promoting the actions of managers and investors to fix any differences. Operating Expenses should  cover the Labor and Overhead costs.

**Administration** has positive and negative inputs. The Cyclo is something expected to happen, which means the positive input. If reality reveals a disparity at the negative input, an action must be taken. For example, when Gain is negative, it is necessary to inject Investment, in order to keep Cyclo spinning.

**Ampli Business Circuits allow the development of unlimited Cyclo and bAmpli combinations. They help investors and managers, at every level of the company, at any time, to have access to the global vision of the organization, and its role in globalization.**

## bAmpli Circuits

Business Ampliers may be grouped to form **bAmpli Circuits**.

For example, the following circuit shows a bAmpli providing investments to leverage three other distinct Cyclos. It can represent an **Angel** investing in **Startups**, for example.

In this case, when the Angel sells its “product”, the entire Startup is negotiated, disappearing from the diagram and fattening the Angel's net profit!

The bAmpli circuit allows analyzing each Cyclo separately.
