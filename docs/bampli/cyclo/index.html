How to provide first-class support for long-term trusts? Based on a fundamental concept introduced by William Deming&rsquo;s process specification:</p><ul><li><strong>This is what I can do for you; here&rsquo;s what you can do for me.</strong></li></ul><p>Also considering that the process stages do not have a one-time-and-done behavior, but a endlessly sequence, repeated for each new product during the working time. An asset always enters in a stage, is processed for some time and goes to the next stage. The process acts as n-stroke engine or n-pole generator, where &ldquo;n&rdquo; is the number of process stages.</p><p>Consider also that the <strong>Process</strong> emphasizes the sustainability, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>The process consumes products of nature, and transform them into other products of nature</strong>.</li></ul><p>In fact, this rule is nothing new. Raw materials are eventually purchased and entered into a process that generates products for sale. Joining both
ends of the process, everything comes out of Earth, everything comes back to Earth.</p><p>Products are bought, processed, combined and become other products to be sold. Each stage individually contributes to keep the process cycle spinning. Together, they should keep up the pace, the teamwork can&rsquo;t stop. The timing determines the <strong>Cyclo</strong> performance, in this case, the spin or angular speed. <strong>Spin</strong>? What turns? See in the diagram that <strong>products</strong> and <strong>money</strong> cycle in opposite directions.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86032/79046804-5dd41d00-7be9-11ea-9239-780095caaffb.png alt="Y3 1 Cyclo bw"></p><p>At the top, Earth&rsquo;s first green arrow to “Sn” indicates the money from the consumer market that pays for Product Sales (PS). This money is used to pay the Raw Materials (RM) used in the Process Stages. The remaining balance is the Gain (G) which contributes to Company&rsquo;s Net Profit.</p><p>On the other hand, the outer blue arrows leaving Earth to &ldquo;S1&rdquo; represent assets traversing the path in the opposite direction. Raw materials are purchased, enter into the process, and become products that the company intends to sell.</p><p><strong>Stages</strong> depend on each other to keep both streams spinning simultaneously:</p><ul><li>Money from selling products to the market by remunerating suppliers.</li><li>Assets collected in the market being transformed into products sold;</li></ul><p>These two streams are closely related, one only happens together with the other. Without payments there are no raw materials in production. Without raw materials there are no revenues. This is crucial for the most important measure to happen!</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong>This project is published in <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Business-Amplifier-M-Sc-Motta-Lopes/dp/B083XGK14Q>Business Amplifier</a>, also <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Business-Amplifier-Jose-Motta-Lopes-ebook-dp-B086L6V6QY/dp/B086L6V6QY/>e-book</a> and <a href=https://www.amazon.com/M-Sc-Jose-Motta-Lopes/dp/8592301009>Amplificador de Negócios</a>.</strong></blockquote></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex justify-between"></div></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></aside></main></body></html>
